Workshop Plan
=============

This is the beginnings of a workshop plan for a one day masterclass on designing with data. Using Brian Suda's book, I have in mind building a workshop that explores data visualisation.

Basics
------

We'll start by designing in Keynote. /* We'll need to get this installed on all the Mac Minis, so the students are working from a common base, with a common toolset. */


APIs or Frameworks
------------------

I think it would be interesing to explore some off-the-shelf tools, e.g. [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com). Build out some exercises using this as a tool to streamline the process.
